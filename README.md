# ERIK's 3D PARTICLE SIMULATOR

Student #: 400062982, name: Erik Kredatus
Assignment 2 for 3GC3

Extra additions: (check SpecialKeys() and HandleKeyboard() key input methods as well as the controls above):
- velocity and position for each particle, combining speed and direction to simulate the effects of inertia and momentum
- camera moved into next initialized particle by pressing 'c'
- added rubber and antiGrav particles randomly spawning
- add a new particle to the start of the list with 'v' permanently increasing particle count at any one time
- shorten the particle spawn list permanently decreasing particle count at any one time with 'b'
