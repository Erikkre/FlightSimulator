## WRITE-UP
The foundation of the project are mostly laid out here in the prototype, with very minor fixes & adjustments needed. One of those adjustments will appear in the camera control, not only additional camera modes but a more advanced camera controls. Another change will be in improving the lighting and shading, along with implementing object meshes for the airplane and other objects we may add. 

The additions into the final that are not currently in the prototype include integrating the particle system we have into the physics, which will appear in collisions, etc. As well as, implementaing proper terrain generation, textures and non-geometric primitives are also a possible addition. We also plan on building on the basic physics to include some preliminary aerodynamics, which will primarly affect the airplanes movement, take-off, and landing. 

Examples:
* Camera:      
1. First-Person (Final)
2. Fixed point  (Final)
3. More advanced camera controls (Final)

* Lighting:
1. Implement fully with normal calculations (Final)
2. Implement different material lighting (Final)

* Shading:
1. Implement shading (Final)

* Textures:
1. Implement a variety of textures for the airplane, terrian, etc. (Final)

* Terrain:
1. Terrain generation (Final)

* Physics improvements
1. Collision detection (Final)
2. Basic aerodynmaics to make flight of airplane more realistic (Final)

* Non-geometric primitives 
1. Implement into object meshes (Final)
